        <h2 class="h1">Popularly known as the ‘Father of the Digital World’, Steve Jobs an American entrepreneur, investor, co-founder of Apple
        Inc. Not the one to be satisfied with a single achievement, he moved on to make history in the world of consumer
        electronics with his foray into the music and cellular industry. The founder of Apple Inc, Pixar Animation Studios and
        NeXT Inc, Jobs gave information technology its life and blood. A master of innovation, he was known for his
        perfectionist attitude and futuristic vision. He foresaw trend in the field of information technology and worked hard to
        embrace the same in his line of products. With about 346 US patents by his side, Steve Jobs created a revolution in his
        field with his novel ideas and unique concepts. During his years at the Apple, he administered the development of the
        iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. He was the mastermind behind the working of the company's Apple Retail Stores,
        iTunes Store and the App Store. Interestingly, with so much to fall back upon, it is quite amusing to know that this
        legendary innovator was not much educated, in fact a college dropout.</h2>
